# ðŸ§® Collatz Conjecture Visualizer

A Python program that calculates the **Collatz sequence** (3n + 1 problem)  
for a range of numbers and **plots their sequence lengths using Matplotlib**.

This project visualizes how many steps it takes for each number to reach 1, helping explore the fascinating behavior of the Collatz conjecture.
